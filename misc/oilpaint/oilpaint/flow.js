// This file is the easiest of the ported modules to keep in parity, and that is by design
// rather than by luck: `flowBlend` promotes both its inputs to float64 on entry, so unlike
// `flatBlend` next door there is no float32 trig anywhere in here and not one `Math.fround`
// until the coherence is stored on the way out. A JS number IS a float64, so the port is

// adds one vortex at a time across the whole array, k = 0..n-1, and so does this.
