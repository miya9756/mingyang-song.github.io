// as being worth watching -- and the pipeline happens to build the picture in exactly the
// order a painter would: a blurred ground, then the coarse underpainting, then the detail
// strokes, then the light. So the intermediate states go to the page as they happen.
//
// Every frame below is a REAL pipeline product at that moment, never an illustration of
// one. The one thing they do not carry is the lighting pass, which is ~0.7 s at 1100 px --
// far too expensive to run per frame. On flat paint it is close to neutral by construction
// (see `light`: a flat surface has ndl == lz, so shade == 1), so what arrives with the
// finished image is the relief and the specular, which is the thing worth waiting for.

// `width:100%;height:100%` into a pane that is at most ~1100 device px, so anything past
// this is converted, copied, transferred and then thrown away by the scaler.
//
// It is "full res" that makes this matter rather than a nicety: frame cost scales with
// AREA while PREVIEW_EVERY_MS is a fixed interval, so on a 12.2 Mpx canvas one frame was
// 48.8 MB and 212 ms of conversion against a 180 ms budget -- the animation was asking for
